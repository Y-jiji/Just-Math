Two elements of a system is semantically equivalent, iff using them interchangeably doesn't affect any meaning. 
Semantical equivalence can be introduced as axioms or can be derived from axioms. 
A system also has several deductive laws, with conditions. When conditions are satisfied, we say a rule can be deduced.
